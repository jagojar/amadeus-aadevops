# **Lab 2(a): End-to-End DevOps: Develop and Test using YAML**
## **Introduction**
In this lab, you will create a pipeline using YAML to build your code and run your unit tests.

You'll learn:
- Understand the basic features of YAML Pipelines.
- Understand the value of Pipelines as code.

## **Prerequisites**  
- Microsoft [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Task 1 from <https://azuredevopslabs.com/labs/azuredevops/prereq/>
- Note: You may want to disable any other CI pipelines before starting the lab to prevent triggering multiple builds at once. 
- If you've completed the previous Pull Requests lab, you may also need to temporarily disable any branch policies on master.
- Multi-stage pipelines preview feature enabled

**Estimated Time To Complete This Lab**  
45 minutes

## **Exercise 1: Introduction to YAML Pipelines**
### **Task 1: Create a YAML pipeline from a template**
1. Navigate to your project in Azure DevOps.
1. Navigate to **Pipelines**, then **Pipelines**.

    ![](content/image1.png)

1. Select **New pipeline** to create a new build pipeline.  

    ![](content/image2.png)

1. Select **Azure Repos Git** as the source.    

    ![](content/image37.png)

1. Next, select the **PartsUnlimited** repo.    

    ![](content/image3.png)

1. In the next screen, pick the ASP.NET template (we could start from an empty template, but the template has some tasks that will be needed anyway and simplifies the initial setup.)

    ![](content/image4.png)

1. Looking at the YAML build pipeline, we can see that it looks like a markup file and contains code for some predefined tasks. By default, the pipeline will be saved as a new file called "azure-pipelines.yml" in the root of the repository and contains everything needed to build and test a typical ASP.NET solution. You can also customize the build as needed. 
1. In this case, update the pool to specify that the build should use a Visual Studio 2017 build VM and add some demands. Be sure to keep it at the same two-space indentation.
    ```
    name: Hosted VS2017
    demands:
    - msbuild
    - visualstudio
    - vstest
    ```
    ![](content/image5.png)
1. Let's test the build pipeline as is by queueing a new build. Click **"Save and run"** near the top.  

    ![](content/image6.png)

1. Update the commit message if you'd like. Leave the **Commit directly to the master branch** selected and click **"Save and run"** again to confirm the commit.  
    
    ![](content/image7.png)

1. The page should update to a view of the build running. By clicking **"Job"** at the bottom, we can view the build log output as our project is being built on a hosted agent. If you want to review an earlier task, you can click to review its logs. Verify that the build is successful.  

    ![](content/image8.png)

1. Select the **Tests** tab to review test results for this build.  

    ![](content/image9.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Task 2: Adding Tasks to YAML Pipelines**
1. Now that our intial build and test processes are successful, we can make additional customizations. From the options(...) dropdown, select **Edit pipeline**.  

    ![](content/image10.png)

1. This should return you to the YAML editor view. Notice a task library that appears to the right. The library can be used to add tasks to your YAML file. This task library contains the same tasks as the Classic pipeline library. You can toggle this view by clicking the hide button as shown below. 

    ![](content/image11.png)

1. In order to be able to deploy the output of our build later, we need to add a task to publish the build output. This will save the output to Azure DevOps. Place the cursor on a blank line after the test step. Try to leave an extra blank line in between tasks to make the pipeline easier to read.  

    ![](content/image12.png)

1. Search the tasks for **"publish pipeline"** and select the **Publish Pipeline Artifacts** task.  

    ![](content/image13.png)

1. Change the **File or directory path** to publish to $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory). Enter the **Artifact name** as 'drop' and click **Add**. This task will publish the pipeline artifacts to a location in Azure DevOps that will be downloadable under the alias **drop**.  

    ![](content/image14.png)

1. Review the code that was added where the cursor was. 

    ![](content/image15.png)

1. Before we save the changes, let's review what triggers this build. Near the top of the YAML file, notice the trigger is set to the master branch. This was set as part of the template we chose in Task 1. Since this YAML file is stored in the master branch, whenever we save a change to the file, a build will automatically be triggered.  

    ![](content/image38.png)    

1. To disable the trigger, modify the statement as shown below.   
    ```
    trigger: none
    ```  
    ![](content/image39.png) 

1. Click **Save** in the top right corner.    

    ![](content/image40.png) 

1. Update the commit message and click **Save** again to commit the changes. Notice no build has been triggered.  

    ![](content/image41.png) 
1. Because we will need the continuous integration trigger in later sections, let's re-enable it. Change the statement back to include master.   
    ```
    trigger: 
    - master
    ```  
    ![](content/image38.png) 

1. When you are ready to test the changes, click **Save**. Saving will commit the changes and now also initiate a new build due to the trigger that we just modified.   

    ![](content/image40.png) 

1. Click **Save** again to save the changes and trigger a new build. 

    ![](content/image42.png) 

1. Let's check for our new build. Return to the **Build Pipelines** view.  

    ![](content/image17.png)

1. Ensure your YAML pipeline is selected. In the build history, there should be a new build with our commit message. Click the build run to open it. 

    ![](content/image18.png)

1. Again, review the build logs and wait for the build to complete. Once the build succeeds, view the newly created artifacts by clicking on **1 Published** next to the section that says **related**.  

    ![](content/image19.png)

1. Expand the drop folder to view the contents.  

    ![](content/image20.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Task 3: Invoking a Continuous Integration Build**
1. As you saw in the previous task, the pipeline was configured to support continuous integration as part of the template. In this section, we will trigger a build as part of a code change. Navigate to the code for this project using **Repos | Files**.  

    ![](content/image21.png)

1. Open the file at **PartsUnlimited-aspnet45/src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/Views/Home/Index.cshtml**  

    ![](content/image22.png)

1. Click **Edit**.  

    ![](content/image23.png)

1. Make a minor cosmetic change, such as by tweaking the title of the document. Click **Commit**.  

    ![](content/image24.png)

1. Add a **comment** and **link a work item** by expanding the drop down. For the purpose of the demo, you can choose any work item. We want to link a work item to show traceability in the later sections. Click **Commit**.  

    ![](content/image25.png)

1. A build should be triggered shortly. Select **Pipelines | Pipelines** to see if it’s in progress.  
    
    ![](content/image26.png)

1. You should now see that a new build is in progress and that it was triggered by your change. Click the build to track it.  
    
    ![](content/image27.png)

1. This build should run and succeed just like the previous build. Under the **Related** section we will see the linked work item. 

    ![](content/image28.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Task 4: Monitor Code and Build KPIs**
1. Next, navigate to the Team Overview dashboard by clicking **Overview | Dashboards** from the left hand menu.  

    ![](content/image29.png)

1. Click Edit. Note: If it's your first time navigating to the Dashboard area, you may have to additionally select the Overview Dashboard before you can click Edit.  

    ![](content/image30.png)

1. Add the **Code Tile** widget.  

    ![](content/image31.png)

1. Configure the widget and point it to the master branch. Click **Save**.  
    
    ![](content/image32.png) ![](content/image36.png)

1. Next, add the **Build History** widget and point it to the build pipeline you created. Click **Save**.  

    ![](content/image33.png)

1. Click **Done Editing** near the top.  

    ![](content/image34.png)

1. The team dashboard should now look similar to the below:  
    
    ![](content/image35.png)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Task 5: Publish Pipeline Artifacts**
1. In this task, we will copy the ARM templates from the Azure Repo to our pipeline artifacts drop location. Navigate back to the YAML pipeline by clicking **Pipelines** | **Pipelines** and selecting the YAML pipeline we have been working with.   

    ![](content/image17.png)

1. Next, click **Edit**.  

    ![](content/image43.png)

1. Between the **VS Test** and **Publish Pipeline Artifact** tasks, add two new blank lines and place your cursor in the middle. This will help make the tasks more readable as we add the next task from the library.  

    ![](content/image44.png)

1. From the tasks library on the right, search for **copy** and select the **Copy Files** task.  

    ![](content/image45.png)

1. Add the following information. The contents filter will select all json files in the env folder and its subdirectories and copy them to the build artifacts folder. Click **Add**.  
    
    **SourceFolder:** \$(build.sourcesdirectory)/PartsUnlimited-aspnet45/env/    
    **Contents:** **/*.json     
    **TargetFolder:** \$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)     
      
    ![](content/image46.png)

1. The YAML pipeline should now contain a copy files task as shown below.  

    ![](content/image47.png)

1. When you are ready to test the changes, click **Save**.  

    ![](content/image40.png) 

1. Enter a commit message and click **Save** again.   

    ![](content/image48.png)

1. A new build should be triggered. Return to the **Build Pipelines** view to check.  

    ![](content/image17.png)

1. Ensure your YAML pipeline is selected. In the build history, there should be a new build with our commit message. Click the build run to open it.  

    ![](content/image49.png)

1. Again, review the build logs and wait for the build to complete. Once the build succeeds, view the newly created artifacts by clicking on **1 published**.  

    ![](content/image19.png)

1. Expand the drop folder to view the contents. We should see a folder with the ARM templates.  

    ![](content/image50.png)
